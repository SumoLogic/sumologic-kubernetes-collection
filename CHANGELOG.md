## [Unreleased]

### Added

- otelcol: add systemd logs pipeline (#1767)

  - This change introduces logs metadata enrichment with Sumo Open Telemetry
    distro for systemd logs (when `sumologic.logs.metadata.provider` is set to
    `otelcol`)

    One notable change comparing the new behavior to `fluentd` metadata enrichment
    is that setting source name in `sourceprocessor` configuration is respected
    i.e.  whatever is set in
    `otelcol.metadata.logs.config.processors.source/systemd:.source_name` will be
    set as source name for systemd logs.

    The old behavior is being retained i.e. extracting the source name from
    `fluent.tag` using `attributes/extract_systemd_source_name_from_fluent_tag`
    processor. For instance, for `fluent.tag=host.docker.service`, source name
    will be set to `docker`.

    In order to set the source name to something else please change
    `otelcol.metadata.logs.config.processors.source/systemd:.source_name`
    configuration value.
