## This file is used as a shared values.yaml file across tests where some configuration
## options are defined that allow collection chart to be installed e.g. on CI runners.
## It most notably:
## * sets the endpoint for sumologic-mock's URL
## * sets lower resource requests for numerous pods that we ran so that they fit
##   on CI runners' machines
