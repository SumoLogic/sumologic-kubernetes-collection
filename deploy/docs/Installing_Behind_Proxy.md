# Installing Behind a Proxy

If your Kubernetes cluster requires outbound traffic to go through a proxy, you will need to set the following properties:

```
sumologic.httpProxy
sumologic.httpsProxy
fluentd.proxyUri
```

You should set these properties to the URL for your proxy environment.

# Troubleshooting

## Error: timed out waiting for the condition

If `helm upgrade --install` hangs, it usually means the pre-install setup job is failing and is in a retry loop.
Due to a Helm limitation, errors from the setup job cannot be fed back to the `helm upgrade --install` command.
Kubernetes schedules the job in a pod, so you can look at logs from the pod to see why the job is failing.
First find the pod name in the namespace where the Helm chart was deployed.
The pod name will contain `-setup` in the name.

 ```sh
 kubectl get pods
 ```

If you see the following in the setup job logs:

```
kubernetes_secret.sumologic_collection_secret: Creating...

   Error: Post "https://kubernetes.default.svc/api/v1/namespaces/sumologic/secrets": Service Unavailable

     on resources.tf line 59, in resource "kubernetes_secret" "sumologic_collection_secret":
     59: resource "kubernetes_secret" "sumologic_collection_secret" {
```

It likely means your proxy is restricting access to `https://kubernetes.default.svc`. Get the IP address of that service by running `kubectl -n default get service kubernetes`and then you can set the following property:

```
sumologic.cluster.host: https://<SERVICE_IP>:443
```
