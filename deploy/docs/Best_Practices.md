## Overriding chart resource names with `fullnameOverride`

Here's an example of using the `fullnameOverride` properties of this chart and its subcharts
to override the created resource names.

```yaml
fullnameOverride: sl

fluent-bit:
  fullnameOverride: fb

kube-prometheus-stack:
  fullnameOverride: kps

  kube-state-metrics:
    fullnameOverride: ksm

  prometheus-node-exporter:
    fullnameOverride: pne
```

After installing the chart, the resources in the cluster will have names similar to the following:

```console
$ kubectl -n <namespace> get pods
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
fb-95sxf                                             1/1     Running       0          91s
kps-operator-6c8999bdfb-b4pks                        1/1     Running       0          91s
ksm-5dbd694cbd-mk4bd                                 1/1     Running       0          91s
pne-r64tk                                            1/1     Running       0          91s
prometheus-kps-prometheus-0                          3/3     Running       1          79s
sl-fluentd-events-0                                  1/1     Running       0          91s
sl-fluentd-logs-0                                    1/1     Running       0          91s
sl-fluentd-logs-1                                    1/1     Running       0          90s
sl-fluentd-logs-2                                    1/1     Running       0          90s
sl-fluentd-metrics-0                                 1/1     Running       0          90s
sl-fluentd-metrics-1                                 1/1     Running       0          90s
sl-fluentd-metrics-2                                 1/1     Running       0          90s
```

⚠️ **Note:** When changing the `fullnameOverride` property for an already installed chart with the `helm upgrade` command,
you need to restart the Fluent Bit and Prometheus pods
for the changed names of the Fluentd or Otelcol pods to be picked up:

```sh
helm -n <namespace> upgrade <release_name> sumologic/sumologic --values changed-fullnameoverride.yaml
kubectl -n <namespace> rollout restart daemonset <fluent_bit_daemonset_name>
kubectl -n <namespace> rollout restart statefulset <prometheus_statefulset_name>
```

As you can see from the example, every subchart has its own `fullnameOverride` property
that needs to be set separately to change the names of the resources created by that subchart.

See the chart's [README](../helm/sumologic/README.md) for all the available `fullnameOverride` properties.

## Multiline Log Support

For logs in Docker format by default, we use a regex that matches the first line of multiline logs
that start with dates in the following format: `2019-11-17 07:14:12`.

If your logs have a different date format you can provide a custom regex to detect
the first line of multiline logs.
See [collecting multiline logs](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=49494) for details
on configuring a boundary regex.

New parsers can be defined under the `fluent-bit.config.customParsers` key in
`values.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
fluent-bit:
  config:
    customParsers: |
      [PARSER]
          Name        multi_line
          Format      regex
          Regex       (?<log>^{"log":"\[?\d{4}-\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}.\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}.*)
      [PARSER]
          Name        new_multi_line_parser
          Format      regex
          Regex       (?<log>^{"log":"\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}.*)
```

This way one can add a parser called `new_multi_line_parser` which matches lines
that start with time of the format : `07:14:12`.

To start using the newly defined parser, define it in `Docker_Mode_Parser` parameter
in the `Input plugin` configuration of fluent-bit in `values.yaml` under
`fluent-bit.config.inputs`:

```
Docker_Mode_Parser new_multi_line_parser
```

The regex used for needs to have at least one named capture group.

For detailed information about parsing container logs please see [here](ContainerLogs.md).

### MySQL slow logs example

For example to detect mulitlines for `slow logs` correctly,
ensure that `Fluent Bit` reads `slow log` files and update your configuration
with following snippet:

```
fluent-bit:
  config:
    customParsers: |
      [PARSER]
          Name        multi_line
          Format      regex
          Regex       (?<log>^{"log":"(\d{4}-\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}.\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}.*|#\sTime:\s+.*))
```

## Collecting Log Lines Over 16KB (with multiline support)

Docker daemon has a limit of 16KB/line so if a log line is longer than that,
it might be truncated in Sumo.
To fix this, fluent-bit exposes a parameter:

``` bash
Docker_Mode  On
```

If enabled, the plugin will recombine split Docker log lines before passing them to any parser.

### Multiline Support

To add multiline support to docker mode, you need to follow the
[multiline log support](#multiline-log-support) section and assign created parser
to the `Docker_Mode_Parser` parameter in the `Input plugin` configuration of fluent-bit:

```
Docker_Mode_Parser multi_line
```

## Collecting logs from /var/log/pods

In order to collect logs from `/var/log/pods`,
please copy full `fluent-bit.config.inputs` section from [values.yaml](../helm/sumologic/values.yaml)
and change `Path` to `/var/log/pods/*/*/*.log`.

In addition, Fluentd and/or OpenTelemetry configuration should be changed as well.

Please take a look at the following examples which contains all of required changes:

```yaml
fluent-bit:
  config:
    inputs: |
      [INPUT]
          Name                tail
          Path                /var/log/pods/*/*/*.log
          Parser              containerd
          Tag                 containers.*
          Refresh_Interval    1
          Rotate_Wait         60
          Mem_Buf_Limit       5MB
          Skip_Long_Lines     On
          DB                  /tail-db/tail-containers-pods-state-sumo.db
          DB.Sync             Normal
      # ... Rest of fluent-bit configuration comes here

## Fluentd change
fluentd:
  logs:
    containers:
      k8sMetadataFilter:
        ## uses docker_id as alias for uid as it's being used in plugin's code directly
        tagToMetadataRegexp: .+?\.pods\.(?<namespace>[^_]+)_(?<pod_name>[^_]+)_(?<docker_id>(?<uid>[a-f0-9\-]{36}))\.(?<container_name>[^\._]+)\.(?<run_id>\d+)\.log$

## OpenTelemetry change
metadata:
  logs:
    config:
      processors:
        attributes/containers:
          actions:
            - action: extract
              key: fluent.tag
              pattern: ^containers\.var\.log\.pods\.(?P<k8s_namespace>[^_]+)_(?P<k8s_pod_name>[^_]+)_(?P<k8s_uid>[a-f0-9\-]{36})\.(?P<k8s_container_name>[^\._]+)\.(?P<k8s_run_id>\d+)\.log$
            - action: insert
              key: k8s.pod.uid
              from_attribute: k8s_uid
            - action: delete
              key: k8s_uid
            - action: delete
              key: k8s_run_id
            - action: insert
              key: k8s.pod.name
              from_attribute: k8s_pod_name
            - action: delete
              key: k8s_pod_name
            - action: insert
              key: k8s.namespace.name
              from_attribute: k8s_namespace
            - action: delete
              key: k8s_namespace
            - action: insert
              key: k8s.container.name
              from_attribute: k8s_container_name
            - action: delete
              key: k8s_container_name
```

## Choosing Fluentd Base Image

Historically, the Fluentd container image used with the collection was based on Debian Linux distribution.

Currently, an Alpine-based image is also available and can be used instead of the Debian-based image.

The Debian-based image is the default, so you do not need to change anything to use it.

To use an Alpine-based image with the collection, specify an Alpine image's tag in `fluentd.image.tag` chart property:

```yaml
fluentd:
  image:
    tag: <Fluentd-release>-alpine
```

For example:

```yaml
fluentd:
  image:
    tag: 1.12.2-sumo-6-alpine
```

Go to the [official Sumo Logic's Fluentd image repository](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sumologic/kubernetes-fluentd)
to find the latest release of Fluentd.
The Alpine-based releases are the ones with the `-alpine` suffix.

Both Debian-based and Alpine-based images support the same architectures:

- x86-64,
- ARM 32-bit,
- ARM 64-bit.

The source code and the `Dockerfile`s for both images can be found at https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-fluentd.

## Fluentd Autoscaling

We have provided an option to enable autoscaling for both logs and metrics Fluentd statefulsets.
This is disabled by default.

Whenever your Fluentd pods CPU consumption is near the limit you could experience a [delay in data ingestion
or even a data loss](monitoring-lag.md) in extreme situations. In such cases you should enable the autoscaling.

To enable autoscaling for Fluentd:

- Enable metrics-server dependency

  Note: If metrics-server is already installed, this step is not required.

  ```yaml
  ## Configure metrics-server
  ## ref: https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/metrics-server/values.yaml
  metrics-server:
    enabled: true
  ```

- Allow metrics-server communication with kubelet for [KOPS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)

  Note: This step is required only for KOPS clusters

  ```yaml
  ## This goes to the kops cluster configuration file
  kubelet:
     # ...
     ## Enable webhook authorization for KOPS cluster
     ## rel: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/7200
     authenticationTokenWebhook: true
     authorizationMode: Webhook
  ```

- Enable autoscaling for Logs Fluentd statefulset

  ```yaml
  fluentd:
    logs:
      ## Option to turn autoscaling on for fluentd and specify metrics for HPA.
      autoscaling:
        enabled: true
  ```

- Enable autoscaling for Metrics Fluentd statefulset

  ```yaml
  fluentd:
    metrics:
      ## Option to turn autoscaling on for fluentd and specify metrics for HPA.
      autoscaling:
        enabled: true
  ```

### CPU resources warning

When enabling the Fluentd Autoscaling please make sure to set Fluentd's `resources.requests.cpu` properly.
Because of Fluentd's single threaded nature it rarely consumes more than `1000m` CPU (1 CPU core).

For example setting `resources.requests.cpu=2000m` and the `autoscaling.targetCPUUtilizationPercentage=50` means
that autoscaling will increase the number of application pods only if average CPU usage across all application pods
in statefulset or daemonset is more than `1000m`. This combined with Fluentd's usage of around `1000m` at most will
result in autoscaling not working properly.

**For this reason we suggest to set the Fluentd's `resources.requests.cpu=1000m` or less when using autoscaling.**

## Fluentd File-Based Buffer

Starting with `v2.0.0` we're using file-based buffer for Fluentd instead of less
reliable in-memory buffer.

The buffer configuration can be set in the `values.yaml` file under the `fluentd`
key as follows:

```yaml
fluentd:
  ## Persist data to a persistent volume; When enabled, fluentd uses the file buffer instead of memory buffer.
  persistence:
    ## After changing this value please follow steps described in:
    ## https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/blob/main/deploy/docs/FluentdPersistence.md
    enabled: true
```

After changing Fluentd persistence setting (enable or disable) follow steps described in [Fluentd Persistence](FluentdPersistence.md).

Additional buffering and flushing parameters can be added in the `extraConf`,
in the `fluentd` buffer section.

```yaml
fluentd:
## Option to specify the Fluentd buffer as file/memory.
   buffer:
     type : "file"
     extraConf: |-
       retry_exponential_backoff_base 2s
```

We have defined several file paths where the buffer chunks are stored.
These can be observed under `fluentd.buffer.filePaths` key in `values.yaml`.

Once the config has been modified in the `values.yaml` file you need to run
the `helm upgrade` command to apply the changes.

```bash
helm upgrade collection sumologic/sumologic --reuse-values -f values.yaml --force
```

See the following links to official Fluentd buffer documentation:

- https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/buffer-section
- https://docs.fluentd.org/buffer/file

### Fluentd buffer size for metrics

Should you have any connectivity problems, depending on the buffer size your setup will
be able to survive for a given amount of time without a data loss, delivering the data
later when everything is operational again.

The FluentD buffer size is controlled by two major parameters - the size of the persistent volume
in Kubernetes, and the maximum size of the buffer on disk. Both need to be adjusted if you want
to buffer more (or less) data.

For example:

```yaml
fluentd:
  ## Persist data to a persistent volume; When enabled, fluentd uses the file buffer instead of memory buffer.
  persistence:
    ## After changing this value please follow steps described in:
    ## https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/blob/main/deploy/docs/FluentdPersistence.md
    enabled: true
    size: 20Gi
  buffer:
    totalLimitSize: "20G"
```

The `fluentd.buffer` section contains other settings for FluentD buffering. Only change those if you know
what you're doing and have studied the relevant documentation carefully.

To calculate this time you need to know how much data you send. For the calculations below
we made an assumption that a single metric data point is around 1 kilobyte in size, including
metadata. This assumption is based on the average data we ingest. By default, for file based
buffering we use gzip compression which gives us around 3:1 compress ratio.

That results in `1 DPM` (Data Points per Minute) using around `333 bytes of buffer`. That is
`333 kilobytes for 1 thousand DPM` and `333 megabytes for 1 million DPM`. In other words - storing
a million data points will use a 333 megabytes of buffer every minute.

This buffer size can be spread between multiple Fluentd instances. To have the best results you
should use the metrics load balancing which can be enabled by using the following setting:
`sumologic.metrics.remoteWriteProxy.enabled=true`. It enables the remote write proxy where nginx
is being used to forward data from Prometheus to Fluentds. We strongly recommend using this
setting as in case of uneven load your buffer storage is as big as single Fluentd instance buffer.
Unfortunately even with `remoteWriteProxy` enabled you might experience uneven load. Because of
that we also `recommend to make your buffers twice the calculated size`.

The formula to calculate the buffering time:

```
minutes = (PV size in bytes * Fluentd instances) / (DPM * 333 bytes)
```

Example 1:  
My cluster sends 10 thousand DPM to Sumo. I'm using default 10 gb of buffer size. I'm also using
3 Fluentd instances. That gives me 30 gb of buffers in total (3 * 10 gb). I'm using 3.33 mb per
minute. My setup should be able to hold data for 9000 minutes, that is 150 hours or 6.25 days.
We recommend treating this as 4500 minutes, that is 75 hours or 3.12 days of buffer.

Example 2:  
My cluster sends 1 million DPM to Sumo. I'm using 20 gb of buffer size. I'm using 20 Fluentd
instances. I have 400 gb of buffers in total (20 * 20 gb). I'm using 333 mb of buffer every minute.
My setup should be able to hold data for around 1200 minutes, that is 20 hours. We recommend treating
this as 600 minutes, that is 10 hours of buffer.

## Excluding Logs From Specific Components

You can exclude specific logs from specific components from being sent to Sumo Logic
by specifying the following parameters either in the `values.yaml` file or the `helm install` command.

```
excludeContainerRegex
excludeHostRegex
excludeNamespaceRegex
excludePodRegex
```

- This is Ruby regex, so all ruby regex rules apply.
  Unlike regex in the Sumo collector, you do not need to match the entire line.
  When doing multiple patterns, put them inside of parentheses and pipe separate them.

- For things like pods and containers you will need to use a star at the end
  because the string is dynamic. Example:

  ```yaml
  excludePodRegex: "(dashboard.*|sumologic.*)"
  ```

- For things like namespace you won’t need to use a star at the end since there is no dynamic string. Example:

  ```yaml
  excludeNamespaceRegex: “(sumologic|kube-public)”
  ```

If you wish to exclude logs based on the content of the log message, you can leverage
the fluentd `grep` filter plugin.
We expose `fluentd.logs.containers.extraFilterPluginConf` which allows you to inject
additional filter plugins to process data.
For example suppose you want to exclude the following log messages:

```
.*connection accepted from.*
.*authenticated as principal.*
.*client metadata from.*
```

In your values.yaml, you can simply add the following to your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
fluentd:
  logs:
    containers:
      extraFilterPluginConf: |-
        <filter containers.**>
          @type grep
          <exclude>
            key log
            pattern /(.*connection accepted from.*|.*authenticated as principal.*|.*client metadata from.*)/
          </exclude>
        </filter>
```

You can find more information on the `grep` filter plugin in the
[fluentd documentation](https://docs.fluentd.org/filter/grep).
Refer to our [documentation](v1_conf_examples.md) for other examples of how you can
customize the fluentd pipeline.

## Excluding Metrics

You can filter out metrics directly in promethus using [this documentation](additional_prometheus_configuration.md#filter-metrics).

You can also exclude metrics by any tag in Fluentd.
For example to filter out metrics from `sumologic` namespace, you can use following configuration:

```yaml
fluentd:
  metrics:
    extraFilterPluginConf: |-
      <filter **>
        @type grep
          <exclude>
            key namespace
            pattern /^sumologic$/
          </exclude>
      </filter>
```

## Excluding Dimensions

You can also exclude dimensions in Fluentd using [record_transformer plugin][record_transformer plugin].
For example to filter out `pod_labels_operator.prometheus.io/name` and `cluster` dimensions,
you can use the following configuration:

```yaml
fluentd:
  metrics:
    extraFilterPluginConf: |-
      <filter **>
        @type record_transformer
        remove_keys $['pod_labels']['operator.prometheus.io/name'],$.cluster
      </filter>
```

Example metric structure which is an input for `extraFilterPluginConf` is presented in the following snippet:

```json
{
  "@metric": "container_memory_working_set_bytes",
  "cluster": "my-cluster",
  "container": "thanos-sidecar",
  "endpoint": "https-metrics",
  "image": "public.ecr.aws/sumologic/thanos:v0.23.1",
  "instance": "10.0.2.15:10250",
  "job": "kubelet",
  "metrics_path": "/metrics/cadvisor",
  "namespace": "sumologic",
  "node": "sumologic-kubernetes-collection",
  "pod": "prometheus-collection-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0",
  "prometheus": "sumologic/collection-kube-prometheus-prometheus",
  "prometheus_replica": "prometheus-collection-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0",
  "@timestamp": 1645772362877,
  "@value": 21032960,
  "prometheus_service": "collection-kube-prometheus-kubelet",
  "pod_labels": {
    "app": "prometheus",
    "controller-revision-hash": "prometheus-collection-kube-prometheus-prometheus-5f68598c76",

    "operator.prometheus.io/shard": "0",
    "prometheus": "collection-kube-prometheus-prometheus",
    "statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name": "prometheus-collection-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0"
  },
  "service": "collection-kube-prometheus-prometheus_prometheus-operated",
  "statefulset": "prometheus-collection-kube-prometheus-prometheus"
}
```

## Add a local file to fluent-bit configuration

If you want to capture container logs to a container that writes locally,
you will need to ensure the logs get mounted to the host so fluent-bit can be
configured to capture from the host.

Example:
In `values.yaml` in the `fluent-bit.config.input` section, you have to add
a new `INPUT` specifying the file path (retaining the remaining part of `input`
config), e.g.:

```yaml
fluent-bit:
  config:
    # ...
    inputs: |-
      # Copy original fluent-bit.config.inputs here
      # ...
      [INPUT]
          Name        tail
          Path        /var/log/syslog
```

Reference: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/tail#configuration-file

**Notice:** In some cases Tailing Sidecar Operator may help in getting logs not available on standard output (STDOUT),
please see section [Get logs not available on stdout](#get-logs-not-available-on-stdout).

## Filtering Prometheus Metrics by Namespace

If you want to filter metrics by namespace, it can be done in the prometheus remote write config.
Here is an example of excluding kube-state metrics for namespace1 and namespace2:

```yaml
 - action: drop
   regex: kube-state-metrics;(namespace1|namespace2)
   sourceLabels: [job, namespace]
```

The section above should be added in each of the kube-state remote write blocks.

Here is another example of excluding up metrics in the sumologic namespace
while still collecting up metrics for all other namespaces:

```yaml
     # up metrics
     - url: http://collection-sumologic.sumologic.svc.cluster.local:9888/prometheus.metrics
       writeRelabelConfigs:
       - action: keep
         regex: up
         sourceLabels: [__name__]
       - action: drop
         regex: up;sumologic
         sourceLabels: [__name__,namespace]
```

The section above should be added in each of the kube-state remote write blocks.

## Modify the Log Level for Falco

To modify the default log level for Falco, edit the following section in the values.yaml file.
Available log levels can be found in Falco's documentation here: https://falco.org/docs/configuration/.

```yaml
falco:
  ## Set the enabled flag to false to disable falco.
  enabled: true
  #ebpf:
  #  enabled: true
  falco:
    jsonOutput: true
    loglevel: debug
```

## Overriding metadata using annotations

You can use [Kubernetes annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/)
to override some metadata and settings per pod.

- `sumologic.com/format` overrides the value of the `fluentd.logs.output.logFormat` property
- `sumologic.com/sourceCategory` overrides the value of the `fluentd.logs.containers.sourceCategory` property
- `sumologic.com/sourceCategoryPrefix` overrides the value of the `fluentd.logs.containers.sourceCategoryPrefix` property
- `sumologic.com/sourceCategoryReplaceDash` overrides the value of the `fluentd.logs.containers.sourceCategoryReplaceDash`
  property
- `sumologic.com/sourceName` overrides the value of the `fluentd.logs.containers.sourceName` property

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: mywebsite
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: mywebsite
      annotations:
        sumologic.com/format: "text"
        sumologic.com/sourceCategory: "mywebsite/nginx"
        sumologic.com/sourceName: "mywebsite_nginx"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Overriding source category with pod annotations

The following example shows how to customize the source category for data from a specific deployment.
The resulting value of `_sourceCategory` field will be `my-component`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-component-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: my-component
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        sumologic.com/sourceCategory: "my-component"
        sumologic.com/sourceCategoryPrefix: ""
        sumologic.com/sourceCategoryReplaceDash: "-"
      labels:
        app: my-component
      name: my-component
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-component
        image: my-image
```

The `sumologic.com/sourceCategory` annotation defines the source category for the data.

The empty `sumologic.com/sourceCategoryPrefix` annotation removes the default prefix added to the source category.

The `sumologic.com/sourceCategoryReplaceDash` annotation with value `-` prevents the dash in the source category
from being replaced with another character.

### Excluding data using annotations

You can use the `sumologic.com/exclude` [annotation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/)
to exclude data from Sumo.
This data is sent to Fluentd, but not to Sumo.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: mywebsite
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: mywebsite
      annotations:
        sumologic.com/exclude: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

#### Including subsets of excluded data

If you excluded a whole namespace, but still need one or few pods to be still included for shipping to Sumo,
you can use the `sumologic.com/include` annotation to include it.
It takes precedence over the exclusion described above.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: mywebsite
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: mywebsite
      annotations:
        sumologic.com/format: "text"
        sumologic.com/sourceCategory: "mywebsite/nginx"
        sumologic.com/sourceName: "mywebsite_nginx"
        sumologic.com/include: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Templating Kubernetes metadata

The following Kubernetes metadata is available for string templating:

| String template  | Description                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `%{namespace}`   | Namespace name                                          |
| `%{pod}`         | Full pod name (e.g. `travel-products-4136654265-zpovl`) |
| `%{pod_name}`    | Friendly pod name (e.g. `travel-products`)              |
| `%{pod_id}`      | The pod's uid (a UUID)                                  |
| `%{container}`   | Container name                                          |
| `%{source_host}` | Host                                                    |
| `%{label:foo}`   | The value of label `foo`                                |

### Missing labels

Unlike the other templates, labels are not guaranteed to exist, so missing labels
interpolate as `"undefined"`.

For example, if you have only the label `app: travel` but you define
`SOURCE_NAME="%{label:app}@%{label:version}"`, the source name will appear as `travel@undefined`.

## Configure Ignore_Older Config for Fluentbit

We have observed that the  `Ignore_Older` config does not work when `Multiline` is set to `On`.
Default config:

```
    [INPUT]
        Name             tail
        Path             /var/log/containers/*.log
        Multiline        On
        Parser_Firstline multi_line
        Tag              containers.*
        Refresh_Interval 1
        Rotate_Wait      60
        Mem_Buf_Limit    5MB
        Skip_Long_Lines  On
        DB               /tail-db/tail-containers-state-sumo.db
        DB.Sync          Normal
```

Please make the below changes to the `INPUT` section to turn off `Multiline` and
add a `docker` parser to parse the time for `Ignore_Older` functionality to work properly.

<pre>
[INPUT]
    Name             tail
    Path             /var/log/containers/*.log
    <b>Multiline        Off</b>
    Parser_Firstline multi_line
    Tag              containers.*
    Refresh_Interval 1
    Rotate_Wait      60
    Mem_Buf_Limit    5MB
    Skip_Long_Lines  On
    DB               /tail-db/tail-containers-state-sumo.db
    DB.Sync          Normal
    <b>Ignore_Older     24h</b>
    <b>Parser           Docker</b>
</pre>

## Disable logs, metrics, or falco

If you want to disable the collection of logs, metrics, or falco, make the below changes
respectively in the `values.yaml` file and run the `helm upgrade` command.

| parameter                   | value | function                   |
|-----------------------------|-------|----------------------------|
| `sumologic.logs.enabled`    | false | disable logs collection    |
| `sumologic.metrics.enabled` | false | disable metrics collection |
| `falco.enabled`             | false | disable falco              |

## Load Balancing Prometheus traffic between Fluentds

Equal utilization of the Fluentd pods is important for collection process.
Unfortunately, Prometheus opens a single persistent connection for each remote write target.
As Kubernetes Services do TCP load balancing on the node level using iptables, rather than
actually proxying the connections, this results in a single FluentD pod getting all the traffic
for a particular remote write target until a timeout or reset occurs.

If the Fluentd pod is under high pressure, incoming connections can be handled with some delay.
To avoid backpressure, `remote_timeout` configuration options for Prometheus' `remote_write` can be used.
By default this is `30s`, which means that Prometheus is going to wait such amount of time
for connection to specific fluentd before trying to reach another.
This significantly decreases performance and can lead to the Prometheus memory issues,
so we decided to override it with `5s`.

```yaml
kube-prometheus-stack:
  prometheus:
    prometheusSpec:
      additionalScrapeConfigs:
        - #...
          remoteTimeout: 5s
```

**NOTE** We observed that changing this value increases metrics loss during prometheus resharding,
but the traffic is much better balanced between Fluentds and Prometheus is more stable in terms of memory.

### Using a load balancing proxy for Prometheus remote write

In environments with a high volume of metrics (problems may start appearing around 30k samples per second),
the above mitigations may not be sufficient. It is possible to remedy the problem by sharding Prometheus
itself, but that can be complicated to set up and require manual intervention to scale.

A simpler alternative is to put a HTTP load balancer between Prometheus and the metrics metadata Service.
This can be enabled in `values.yaml` via the `sumologic.metrics.remoteWriteProxy.enabled` key.

## Changing scrape interval for Prometheus

Default scrapeInterval for collection is `30s`. This is the recommended value which ensures that all of Sumo Logic dashboards
are filled up with proper data.

To change it, you can use following configuration:

```yaml
kube-prometheus-stack:  # For values.yaml
  prometheus:
    prometheusSpec:
      scrapeInterval: '1m'
```

## Get logs not available on stdout

When logs from a pod are not available on stdout, [Tailing Sidecar Operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar)
can help with collecting them using standard logging pipeline.
To tail logs using Tailing Sidecar Operator the file with those logs needs to be accessible through a volume
mounted to sidecar container.

Providing that the file with logs is accessible through volume, to enable tailing of logs using Tailing Sidecar Operator:

- Enable Tailing Sidecar Operator by modifying `values.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  tailing-sidecar-operator:
    enabled: true
  ```

- Add annotation to pod from which you want to tail logs in the following format:

  ```yaml
  metadata:
    annotations:
      tailing-sidecar: <sidecar-name-0>:<volume-name-0>:<path-to-tail-0>;<sidecar-name-1>:<volume-name-1>:<path-to-tail-1>
  ```

Example of using Tailing Sidecar Operator is described in the
[blog post](https://www.sumologic.com/blog/tailing-sidecar-operator/).

## Adding custom fields

In order to add custom fields to container logs, the following configuration has to be applied:

```yaml
fluentd:
  logs:
    containers:
      extraFilterPluginConf: |
        <filter **>
          @type record_modifier
          <record>
            _sumo_metadata ${{:_fields => "<DEFINITION OF CUSTOM FIELDS>"}}
          </record>
        </filter>
      extraOutputPluginConf: |
        <filter **>
          @type record_modifier
          <record>
            _sumo_metadata ${record["_sumo_metadata"][:fields] = "#{record["_sumo_metadata"][:fields]},#{record["_sumo_metadata"][:_fields]}"; record["_sumo_metadata"]}
          </record>
        </filter>
```

where `<DEFINITION OF CUSTOM FIELDS>` has to be `key1=value1,key2=value2,...` formatted string.

**NOTE** Do not forget to [add field in Sumo Logic service][sumo_add_fields]

[sumo_add_fields]: https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Fields#add-field

Please consider the following configuration which adds `container_image` from kubernetes enrichment.

```yaml
fluentd:
  logs:
    containers:
      extraFilterPluginConf: |
        <filter **>
          @type record_modifier
          <record>
            _sumo_metadata ${{:_fields => "container_image=#{record["kubernetes"]["container_image"]}"}}
          </record>
        </filter>
      extraOutputPluginConf: |
        <filter **>
          @type record_modifier
          <record>
            _sumo_metadata ${record["_sumo_metadata"][:fields] = "#{record["_sumo_metadata"][:fields]},#{record["_sumo_metadata"][:_fields]}"; record["_sumo_metadata"]}
          </record>
        </filter>
```

## Using custom Kubernetes API server address

In order to change API server address, the following configurations can be used.

For the Fluentd:

```yaml
fluentd:
  apiServerUrl: http://my-custom-k8s.api:12345
```

For the Opentelemetry Collector:

```yaml
metadata:
  logs:
    statefulset:
      extraEnvVars:
      - name: KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST
        value: my-custom-k8s.api
      - name: KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT
        value: '12345'
  metrics:
    statefulset:
      extraEnvVars:
      - name: KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST
        value: my-custom-k8s.api
      - name: KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT
        value: '12345'
```

## OpenTelemetry queueing and batching

OpenTelemetry comes with several parameters related to queue management.

For [batch processor][batch_processor]:

- `send_batch_size` defines the number of items (logs, metrics, traces) in one batch before it's sent further down the pipeline.
- `timeout` defines time after which the batch is sent regardless of the size (can be lower than `send_batch_size`).
- `send_batch_max_size` is an upper limit of the batch size.

_We could say that `send_batch_size` is a soft limit and `send_batch_max_size` is a hard limit of the batch size._

For [sumologic exporter][sumologic_exporter]:

- `max_request_body_size` defines maximum size of requests to sumologic before compression.
- `timeout` defines connection timeout. It is recommended to adjust this value in relation to `max_request_body_size`.

- `sending_queue.num_consumers` is the number of consumers that dequeue batches. It translates to maximum number of parallel connections to the sumologic backend.
- `sending_queue.queue_size` is capacity of the queue in terms of batches (batches can vary between `1` and `send_batch_max_size`)

**As effective value of `sending_queue.queue_size` depends on current traffic,**
**there is no way to figure out optimal PVC size in relation to `sending_queue.queue_size`.**
**Due to that, we recommend to set `sending_queue.queue_size` to high value in order to use maximum resources of PVC.**

**The above in connection with PVC monitoring can lead to constant alerts (eg. [KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp][filling_up_alert]),**
**because once filled in PVC never reduces its fill.**

[batch_processor]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/v0.47.0/processor/batchprocessor#batch-processor
[sumologic_exporter]: https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/tree/v0.47.0-sumo-0/pkg/exporter/sumologicexporter#sumo-logic-exporter
[filling_up_alert]: https://runbooks.prometheus-operator.dev/runbooks/kubernetes/kubepersistentvolumefillingup/

### Compaction

The OpenTelemetry Collector doesn't have a compaction mechanism.
Local storage can only grow - it can reuse disk space that has already been allocated, but not free it.
This leads to a situation where the database file can grow a lot (due to a spike in data traffic)
but after some time only small piece of the file will be used for data storage (until next spike).

### Examples

Here are some useful examples and calculations for queue and batch parameters.

For the calculations below we made an assumption that a single metric data point is around 1 kilobyte in size, including metadata.
This assumption is based on the average data we ingest.
Persistent storage doesn't compress data so we assume that single metric data point takes 1 kilobyte on disk as well.

`number_of_instances` represents number of `sumologic-otelcol-metrics` instances.

#### Outage with huge metrics spike

Let's consider a huge metrics spike in your network while connection to the Sumologic is down.
Huge load means that batch processor is going to push batches due to `send_batch_max_size` instead of `timeout`.
The reliability of the system can be calculated using the following formulas:

- If limited by queue_size: `number_of_instances*send_batch_max_size*sending_queue.queue_size/load_in_DPM` minutes.
- If limited by PVC size: `number_of_instances*PVC_size/(1KB*load_in_DPM)` minutes.

#### Outage with low DPM load

Let's consider a low but constant load in your network while connection to the Sumologic is down.
Low load means that batch processor is going to push batches due to `timeout` instead of `send_batch_max_size`.
The reliability of the system can be calculated using the following formulas:

- If limited by queue_size: `number_of_instances*timeout[min]*sending_queue.queue_size/load_in_DPM` minutes.
- If limited by PVC size: `number_of_instances*PVC_size/(1KB*load_in_DPM)` minutes.
