# How to install if you have standalone Prometheus

Update your Prometheus configuration fileâ€™s `remote_write` section, as per the documentation [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write), by taking the `remoteWrite` section of the `prometheus-overrides.yaml` file, and making the following changes:

* `writeRelabelConfigs:` change to `write_relabel_configs:`
* `sourceLabels:` change to `source_labels:`
*  Modify remote URLs in the `remoteWrite` section of the `prometheus-overrides.yaml` file

The URLs in `remoteWrite` section of the `prometheus-overrides.yaml` file uses `env` variables which need to be changed to point to the correct location.

- Replace `$(CHART)` with the `release name-namespace` that you have used while installing the Sumo Logic helm chart.
- Replace `$(NAMESPACE)` with the namespace where Prometheus is running.

For example:
If you have installed the Sumo Logic helm chart with release name `collection` in the `sumologic` namespace and Prometheus is running in the `prometheus` namespace:
```
`$(CHART).$(NAMESPACE)` will be replaced by `collection-sumologic.prometheus`
```
