# How to install if you have standalone Prometheus

Update your Prometheus configuration fileâ€™s `remote_write` section, as per the documentation [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write), by taking the `remoteWrite` section of the `prometheus-overrides.yaml` file, and making the following changes:

* `writeRelabelConfigs:` change to `write_relabel_configs:`
* `sourceLabels:` change to `source_labels:`

__NOTE__ To filter or add custom metrics to Prometheus, [please refer to this document](additonal_prometheus_configuration.md)
