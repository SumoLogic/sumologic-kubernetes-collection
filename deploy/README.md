# Deployment Guide

This page has instructions for collecting Kubernetes logs, metrics, and events; enriching them with deployment, pod, and service level metadata; and sending them to Sumo Logic. See our [documentation guide](https://help.sumologic.com/Solutions/Kubernetes_Solution) for details on our Kubernetes Solution.

## Solution overview

The diagram below illustrates the components of the Kubernetes collection solution.

![solution](/images/k8s_collection_diagram.png)

* **K8S API Server**. Exposes API server metrics.
* **Scheduler.** Makes Scheduler metrics available on an HTTP metrics port.
* **Controller Manager.** Makes Controller Manager metrics available on an HTTP metrics port.
* **node-exporter.** The `node_exporter` add-on exposes node metrics, including CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization.
* **kube-state-metrics.** Listens to the Kubernetes API server; generates metrics about the state of the deployments, nodes, and pods in the cluster; and exports the metrics as plaintext on an HTTP endpoint listen port.
* **Prometheus deployment.** Scrapes the metrics exposed by the `node-exporter` add-on for Kubernetes and the `kube-state-metric`s component; writes metrics to a port on the Fluentd deployment.
* **Fluentd deployment.** Forwards logs and metrics to HTTP sources on a hosted collector. Includes multiple Fluentd plugins that parse and format the metrics and enrich them with metadata.
* **Events Fluentd deployment.** Forwards events to an HTTP source on a hosted collector.

NOTE: Helm 3 compatibility is in the early stages and is not fully tested or supported. Please refer to this [guide](docs/Helm3.md) for more information on Helm 3. We recommend you thoroughly test the use of Helm 3 in your pre-production environments before use.

The following matrix displays the tested package versions for our Helm chart.
